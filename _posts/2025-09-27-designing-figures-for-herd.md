I first heard about Letibus Design when Shut Up & Sit Down covered their puzzle book Lok in their [Three Great Word Games You Should Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMyChb91azI) video. I got the [print-and-play version of Lok](https://letibus.itch.io/lok) and started playing it immediately! It has become one of my favourite puzzle games (even when counting videogames), although I've yet to finish it... I proceeded to get the physical version of Lok, gifting it to anyone I could think of.

Later, in September 2023, I got their newsletter "Herd - A new puzzle book demo", which looked very intriguing! I printed out the book pages (it might have been using the work printer - don't tell anyone!), but didn't have figures to play with - the demo planned to include some figurines for 3D printing, but they weren't ready yet. I didn't want to wait, however, so I opened up Autodesk Fusion (my CAD program of choice - they have a free [hobbyist version](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal)!) and spent a couple hours designing them, trying to copy their look from the book as well as I could, including the cute faces.

And they came out better than I could have hoped for! So I joined the [Letibus Club discord](https://discord.gg/vqNdS3zG7k) to show everyone the results, and that got me talking with the designer [Bla탑 Urban Gracar](https://www.blazgracar.com/). We later moved the conversation to a private chat, tweaking the design and talking about boardgames and stuff, and after some time, Bla탑 asked me what I'd think about having my designs in the final game! That led to many other tweaks, and a full redesign of the "faces" at one point, but I think we're both really happy with the final result :-) I even got to work on the 3D renders of the figures for the box and rulebook, which was an interesting new challenge for me.

Herd was supposed to come out in the first half of 2025, but that didn't work out because of my figures (indirectly). You can read more in the devlog [here](https://letibus.itch.io/herd/devlog/939684/herds-release-postponement). In the end, the figures are made with injection moulding, which is honestly still a strange feeling for me, somehow feels even more "real".

The final figures are shiny, which wasn't how I imagined tham, but Bla탑 who's seen them in person really likes them, and says they look like pieces of candy :-)

I honestly can't wait until I get the final game in my hands and see all the tiny details and easter eggs that Bla탑 was able to put into the pages.

If you're interested in Herd, you can subscribe to the [Letibus newsletter](https://www.blazgracar.com/herd), so that you're notified when it comes out. It will be available both as a physical game and as a digital print-and-play, so that you can print both the figures and the book at home, or maybe play on a tablet.

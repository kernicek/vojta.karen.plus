I first heard about Letibus Design when Shut Up & Sit Down covered their puzzle book Lok in their [Three Great Word Games You Should Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMyChb91azI) video.

## Photo of Lok

I got the [print-and-play version](https://letibus.itch.io/lok) of Lok and started playing it immediately! It has become one of my favourite puzzle games (even including videogames), although I've yet to actually finish it, the later puzzles are fairly complicated... I proceeded to get the physical version of Lok, gifting it to anyone who might enjoy it.

## Some other photo maybe?

Later, in September 2023, I got their newsletter titled "Herd - A new puzzle book demo", which looked very intriguing, and included PnP files! I printed out the book pages (it might have been using the printer at work - don't tell anyone!), but didn't have any figurines to play with - the demo planned to include some figurines for 3D printing, but they weren't ready yet.

## Original figures plans

I didn't want to wait, however, so I opened up Autodesk Fusion (my CAD program of choice - they have a free [hobbyist version](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal) available!), designed the planned figurines based on the included photos and printed them out.

## Add photo of original figures

They were usable, but I felt they didn't really fit the theme of the game, because they didn't look like the cute creatures from the book, which caused a disconnect for me. But it seemed that making ones based on the characters in the game would be a fun challedge and within the scope of my abilities, so I spent a couple hours designing them, trying to copy their look from the book as well as I could, including the cute faces. And they came out better than I could have hoped for!

I didn't want to just print them myself and forget about it, so I joined the Letibus Club [discord](https://discord.gg/vqNdS3zG7k) to show everyone the results. And that got me talking with the designer [Blaž Urban Gracar](https://www.blazgracar.com/). We later moved the conversation to a private chat, tweaking the design and chatting about boardgames and all kinds of stuff, getting them to stack as neatly as possible and to look like he imagined.

## Add photo of some design stuff

After some time, Blaž asked me what I'd think about having my designs in the final game! I of course said yes, and that led to a host of other tweaks. We even went through a full redesign of the "faces" at one point, to make them maybe even cuter?

## Add a photo of the different faces

But I think we're both really happy with the final result :-) I even got to work on the 3D renders of the figures for the box and rulebook, which was a fun new challenge for me.

## Add a photo of the renders

Herd was supposed to come out in the first half of 2025, but that didn't work out because of my figures (indirectly). You can read more in the devlog [here](https://letibus.itch.io/herd/devlog/939684/herds-release-postponement). In the end, the figures were made with injection moulding, which is honestly still a strange feeling for me, somehow feels even more "real".

The final figures are shiny, which wasn't how I imagined tham, but Blaž (who's seen them in person) really likes them, and says they look like pieces of candy :-)

I honestly can't wait until I get the final game in my hands and see all the tiny details and easter eggs that Blaž was able to put into the book.

If you're interested in Herd, you can subscribe to the [Letibus newsletter](https://www.blazgracar.com/herd), so that you're notified when it comes out. It will be available both as a physical game and as a digital print-and-play, so that you can print both the figures and the book at home, or maybe play on a tablet.

Since 2024, I've been helping out with the organisation of the Future Gate sci-fi film festival, which takes place every year in cities around the Czech Republic.
My main responsibility is the merch shop, so you'll most likely find me there in Prague and Brno. I also created a sci-fi quiz for 2025.

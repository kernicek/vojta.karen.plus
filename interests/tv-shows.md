# My favourites:
I like all kinds of TV shows, so I split this one into categories...
### Comedy
 - **Game Changer:** A game show with comedians doing friendly competitions, where the rules are different in (almost) every episode! The first show from [Dropout.tv](https://dropout.tv) on this list.
 - **Make Some Noise:** Spin-off from Game Changer, that is even lest competitive. This is my happy place!
 - **The Goes Wrong Show:** A recent addition that I've seen multiple times already, it just always makes me laugh!
 - **Brooklyn Nine-Nine:** "Nine-Nine!" This and The Office are always trading each other in my favourite sitcom spot.
 - **The Office (US):** As much as I like the UK original, the US version just does it for me. 

### Animation
  - **Gravity Falls:** It might look like it's for kids, but it's actually really smart in addition to being really funny.
  - **Futurama:** Does it even need an introduction?

### More serious stuf, kinda?
 - **Doctor Who:** It's a little silly sometimes, but it still has a special place in my heart. Favourite Doctor? 10, David Tennant is just the best!
 - **Slow Horses:** Spy show about MI5 rejects who somehow always have to save the day. Gary Oldman and the rest of the cast just kill it in this one! And the books are worth a read as well.
 - **The Expanse:** A really intriguing sci-fi epic with relatable characters, that tries to be as realistic as possible. I prefer the books to the show, but still love it.

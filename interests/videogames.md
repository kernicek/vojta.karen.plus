# The beginnings
My parents don't really like video games. There was only one exception in my childhood - somewhere, they found [The Neverhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverhood) and actually played it with us! I was fascinated with, and I still have a special relationship with it.

Later, my grandfather gave me a Gameboy Advance with two games - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (a surprisingly good RPG that really works with the GBA graphics) and Disney Sports: Snowboarding (kinda forgettable, but I still enjoyed it). IT is one of my most prized possesions.

# My favourites:
These are some of my favourite video games:
 - **Outer Wilds:** everyone should play this one!
 - **Life is Strange:** this is a game that I have a real emotional bond to. If you ever play it, read the comic books afterwards!
 - **Horizon Zero Dawn:** The open world gameplay combined with the tribal post-post-apocalyptic setting and robotic dinosaurs really works for me. Also, I really like Ashly Burch!
 - **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild:** I've spent many hours in Hyrule, and will again
 - **Control**: the world is really intriguing, and the new powers you gain are really fun to play with

I really like films, but don't actually watch them that much, because I want to give them the proper atmosphere they require, which is harder to do sometimes...

# My favourites
These are some of my all time favourites:
 - **Moon (2009):** Do you like Sam Rockwell? Then go watch him in this great sci-fi mystery film.
 - **Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (2010):** "Not so long ago... in the mysterious land... of Toronto, Canada..." This film always makes me happy.
 - **Palm Springs (2020):** Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti are just perfect in this one. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it. And try going in blind!
 - **Remember Sunday (2013):** Yeah, this film isn't perfect by any measure (and don't look up Zachary Levi's political opinions), but I still always cry at the end...
 - **Nimona (2023):** Futuristic medieval world? Demons? Bromance? Count me in!
 - **Arrival (2016):** The most recent addition to this list, Amy Adams really kills it in this surprisingly thoughful sci-fi film.

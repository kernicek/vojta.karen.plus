I got myself a 3D printer at the beginning of 2020 (even before the pandemic hit actually), and it has really opened up my ability to make stuff.

I try to mostly print useful things, but also spent over 150 hours of print-time making an awesome copy of [Hextraction](https://www.playhextraction.com/), so...

I currently have three (or 4, kinda) 3D printers:
 - ***Ender 3:** This was the first 3D printer I got, but it's been broken for quite some time now and I haven't had the motivation to fix it. But it got my into the hobby!*
 - **Prusa MK3.5S ('Natasha'):** I really like my Prusa, it's not perfect but does what I want from it, and with the upgrade to MK3.5S, actually does it fairly fast.
 - **Elegoo Neptune 4 Max ('Bruce'):** This printer is HUUUGE! I wholly recommend open-sourcing it with [OpenNeptune](https://github.com/OpenNeptune3D/OpenNept4une) if you get it.
 - **Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro ('Tony'):** Bruce's smaller brother, it's not perfect but I make it work.

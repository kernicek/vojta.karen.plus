I love technology. I was the first person in my high-school who had a smartphone, and I love all kinds of devices.

# My favourite devices
## Non-gaming
 - **Kindle Oasis (jailbroken):** The physical buttons alone make this worth it for me. And after I jailbroke it and installed KOreader, it's the perfect e-book reader for me. I hope it lasts for a long time!
 - **TCL Nxtpaper 14:** My current tablet, it's huuge and the paper-like coating makes it perfect for reading comic books!
 - **Motorola Edge 50 Neo:** My current phone, pretty much the smallest I could find. The software isn't great unfortunately.
 - **Canon 90D:** My camera - it's pretty big, but I love it. My favourite lens is the Sigma Art 18-35mm f1.8.
 - **Synology DS918+:** My home NAS that I have equipped with 4*16TB drives. I like the simplicity, but might migrate to a self-built solution once I run out of space (which will be soon).

## Gaming
 - **Steam Deck OLED:** I pre-ordered a Steam Deck on day one, and afterwards upgraded to the OLED version. It has become my primary gaming device by a long mile, and I can't wait to see what they do next.
 - **Gameboy Advance:** I got one from my late grandfather when I was 10, but for actual gaming, I bought another one and modded it with an IPS screen, USB-C rechargeable battery and an Everdrive Mini flashcart.
 - **New Nintendo 3DS XL:** This is my (almost) every-day-carry gaming device. And I the 3D is a surprisingly good feature.

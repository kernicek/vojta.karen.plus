I don't read as much as I'd want lately, but try to at least supplement it with audiobooks.

# Favourites
My favourite book list used to be full of Neil Gaiman books. I haven't decided how I feel about reading them now, however, so I won't list them here.
## Fiction
 - **Terry Pratchett& Neil Gaiman: Good Omens:** I could read this book over and over and I'd still find new things in it.
 - **James S. A. Corey: The Expanse series:** A sci-fi series that's epic and personal at the same time. Also adapted into a TV show.
 - **John Morressy: Kedrigern series:** Probably my favourite books from childhood.
 - **Andrej Sapkowski: The Witcher series:** Extremely well known because of the games, but really worth reading!

## Non-fiction *(such a stupid name, isn't it?)*
 - **Matt Parker: Humble Pi:** A very funny book full of interesting maths stories and facts.
 - **Randall Munroe: What If?:** A very fun nerdy science book from the creator of [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/). Do you see a pattern here?
 - **Devon Price: Unmasking Autism:** Here's a confession: I haven't actually finished this book yet, but it has still taught me so much about Neurodiversity and the way people's brains work.

## Comic books
 - **Jeff Smith: Bone series:** This is an epic comic book story that can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike.
 - **Emma Vieceli: Life is Strange (6 volumes):** This series takes place after one of the endings of the Life is Strange videogame, and it's the only time I've ever cried while reading a comic book. Wholeheartedly recommended to fans of the game!

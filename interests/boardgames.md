# The beginnings
I've loved playing board games all my life, the earliest one I can remember was a home-made game called Potápěči (scuba-divers) that my parents made when there weren't many games available.

When I was little, we played a lot of [Labyrinth](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1219/labyrinth), and even had some full-day sessions of [Talisman](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/714/talisman) with my 9-years-older sister and later with my 7-years-younger brother.

# The start of the collection
The first board games I ever bought with my own money were [Munchkin](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1927/munchkin) and [Ticket to Ride](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9209/ticket-to-ride). I've since gotten rid of both of them:
- I really loved the theme and humour of Munchkin, but hate how competitive it is, and that the winner is determined by when all other players run out of cards to prevent the player from leveling up.
- I love Ticket to Ride, but have played it so much that I usually win, which is not fun for the othe players. I sometimes still play the digital version though!

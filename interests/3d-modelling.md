title: 3D modelling
subtitle: Parametric modelling FTW!

I tried some 3D modelling in Blender in University, but only got into it properly once I got a 3D printer. And now, I actually prefer the modelling to the printing.

The biggest thing I ever designed was a 3D printed guitar for my dad's 60th birthday. I'll add some photos once I get to it, it's really awesome!

I got to design the figures for the solo puzzle board game [Herd](/projects/herd).
